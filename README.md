## Overview
The purpose of this project was to look at bike ride share data from New York City to see if it would be a good idea
to start a bike sharing program/company in Des Moines, Iowa. The data is from August of 2019. 

## Results

	Checkout Times for Users: 
This graph show that most bike trips only lastet around 5 minutes and almost were under an hour of use.

	Checkout Times for Users by Gender: 
This graph shows that there are almost triple the amount of male riders versus female riders, but the ride durations are still proportional and there is not a duration difference based on gender.

	Trips by Weekday Hour: 
This graph shows what you might expect, that there are high amounts of trips during the morning and afternoon work commute time during the week and a more balanced spread of trips during the weekend days.

	Trips by Weekday Hour by Gender: 
This graph doesn't tell us much more, just showing there are more male riders. Gender does not have an affect on what time of day trips are taken.

	Trips by User Type: 
This graph shows that subscribers are way more likely to take bike trips than non-subscribing customers.

	End Locations: 
This map shows the end locations for the bike trips. Most of the trips end in a high concentrated area.

	Start Times: 
This chart shows the amount of bike trips started each hour. The most active times are the morning and afternoon work commute hours.

## Summary
Overall, I think this was a poor data set to use for determining if a ride share program would work in Des Moines.
The data only really points to four helpful items:
- Gender does not play a role in the length of bike use, but there are 3 times as many male riders as female riders.
	- This could be used in Des Moines to initially market to males and then focus on getting more female riders to expand.
- Most rides are only 5 minutes long and the vast majority of rides are under an hour long.
	- This could be used in Des Moines be looking at average distances of commutes. Des Moines' riders may have further distances to travel and cost of trips may need to be adjusted based on this.
- Most rides are taken during the morning and afternoon work rushes during the week and more evenly distributed on the weekends.
- Subscribing customers are more likely to take multiple trips compared to non-subscribing customers.
	
Two visualizations that would be nice to have for further analysis would be:
- Number of rides and duration of rides versus temperature and/or precipitation.
- Age of customers versus number and duration of rides.
